# Pocket Dimensions RL

## About

Pocket Dimensions RL is a seven day roguelike made for the 7DRL Challenge 2019. It is written in Javascript using the rot.js library. You can play it on itch.io at https://laurheth.itch.io/pocket-dimensions-rl or on github at https://laurheth.github.io/pocket-universe-7drl

## The story so far...
You are a Portal Wizard, recently graduated from the Portal Wizard Academy. But on your graduation day, a cabal of evil wizards, using the power of the legendary Wand of Nerual, shattered the world into separate pockets of space!

As a freshly minted Portal Wizard, you have the power to manipulate the gateways connecting these disjointed pocket realities. With this power, you will traverse the shattered world, find the Wand of Nerual, and with it, make the world whole again!

Unfortunately, you skipped class the day they taught fighting at the Portal Wizard Academy. You will have to rely on your skills of running, pushing and shoving, and drinking coffee.

## How to Play
### Movement:
- Numpad, arrow keys, or VI keys (hjklyubn)
- '.' to wait a turn.
### Inventory:
- 'i' to open Inventory. 'g' to Get items.
- 'z' to Zap your held wand.
- Some items have unexpected effects. For instance, good coffee is very, very hot. Try melting glaciers if you get stuck.
### Portal manipulation:
- 'o' to Open adjacent portals. 'c' to Close them.
- 'a' to Acquire a portal, 'd' to Drop it.
- You can only hold one portal at a time. Portals realign on both ends when you drop them, sometimes significantly. Use this to bypass obstacles!
### Other:
- 'x' to eXamine your surroundings.
- '?' to print instructions.
